--INTRODUCTION--
The purpose of this project is to give users storing Assessment Inventory and Monitoring (AIM) data within the Database for Inventory, Monitoring and Assessment (DIMA) a quick and portable was to aggregate and process raw data for a variety of available methods. This project also provides a number of quality control checks that can be used to find errors in the collected data. Data are imported from DIMA (MS Access) into a SQLite database for processing.

--USE--
Users need to have python 3.x (64bit recommended due to memory usage) installed and from their command line environment run the main.py file (e.g. python3 /path/to/main.py). See the requirements.txt file for required modules. Users can use pip to install the required modules (e.g. pip -r  /path/to/requirements.txt).
Simple usage would be the following:
1)	Create new blank database with the ‘Create New Database’ button.  This will create a new blank reporting database.  Users can customize the SQL scripts in the /sql/ folder to alter the database as needed for a specific project.  Users can also use the ‘Run SQL Script’ Button to run custom SQL in the database after creation in order to customize.
2)	Use the ‘Import DIMA Data’ button to import one or more DIMA data sets into the database. Users will be asked if they prefer to delete existing data or not.  In the case of records with identical primary keys, existing data are given precedence.
3)	Users can then click the ‘Export’ button in order to export final products or QC checks into a Microsoft Excel format.
4)	If users want to switch back and forth between different reporting databases they can use the ‘Connect to Database’ button to change the database they are connected to, which is listed at the top of the form.
A couple more things to note: Users customizing the SQL scripts must maintain the same script names within the /sql/ path.  It is recommended at this time for multiple projects needing different setup scripts that users create different backup paths for the script sets (e.g. /sql_project1, /sql_project2, etc.). An alternative to this method would be to write a customization script for each project and run it/them via the ‘Run SQL script’ button. As SQLite does not use the ALTER VIEW statement, users will have to use the DROP VIEW and CREATE VIEW statements.

--CONFIGURATION--
Currently the way the database behaves can be modified through altering certain data inserted into the database via the insert_config.sql script. CAUTION: changing these values without knowing how it will affect the database may result in a broken database or in one that produces incorrect or unexpected values.
Turning on and off the export of certain QAQC scripts during the export process can be done via the 'use_check' field of the QAQC_Queries table.  A zero in this field will tell the database not to use/export that particular query. For this process, an UPDATE statement post DB creation will work.

--ADDING NON-DIMA DATA--
Currently there are a number of tables in the database that may need to be populated manually if they want to be used.  
1)	EcositeGroups: serves as a way to group plots of the same ecosite together into bigger groups for processing.
2)	PlotTags: serves as a way to group plots together for processing.  Some are populated automatically via the insert_tags.sql script, but users may want to create manual groupings themselves.
3)	SoilSeries: serves as a way to check if valid soil series are listed in plot data during QAQC checks.
4)	SpeciesTags: serves as a way to group plant species together for processing.  Some are populated automatically via the insert_tags.sql script, but users may want to create manual groupings themselves.
5)	Data_DateRange: serves to define valid data ranges and to demarcate separate data collection seasons.  This will be populated automatically with some default values on DB creation, but users may want to create a different setup for non-standard seasonality.  NOTE: Currently this must be inserted into sql scripts before the database is created.  A good place to do this would be at the end of the insert_config.sql script.
Examples of adding data via an sql script can be found in the /sql folder in the 'example_data.sql' file.

--KNOWN ISSUES--
1)	The loading of entire SQL scripts can be burdensome if there are any errors anywhere (the whole script will fail).  Future implementations may attempt to split the scripts into individual SQL statements for processing via some sort of comment tag(s) or attempt some other methodology.
2)	Occasional MemoryError exceptions may be raised in python due to the large amount of data and the complexity of the views. Python 64 bit is recommended for this reason.  If this continues to be an issue, methods will have to be developed to mitigate the issue.
